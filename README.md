# Tic-tac-toe 

### *Abstract*

>I built a functional app which allows two human players to play tic-tac-toe. The problem it solves is bordem and can give players a break from their day to day computer work. It's a classic game that has never gone out of style! 

### *Installation Instructions*

> To get this app running users will need to go to (https://github.com/Jnguyen615/Tic-Tac-Toe) to see the repository for the project. Then by hitting the green code button you can use the SSH key to clone the repository down to your machine. To do this you the user would need to open their terminal and type `git clone` followed by the copied SSH key. Then from terminal the user can open the project by typing `open index.html` From there the app will open in the users preferred broswer.

### *Context* 

> I had a week to complete this project with a lot of work time during weekdays and weekends. It took at least 30 hours to complete this project as a mod 1 student.

### *Learning Goals*

> The major learning goals start with demonstraing an understaing of html, css, javascript and event delegation. The project should show an understanding of the differences between the DOM and data model and how to work with and manipulate them. Laslty it should help teach and show how to use a problem solving process to break down larger problems in order to get things done step by step and fully functional. This project gave free reign on design which shows off an understanding of css and how to work with it.

## *Wins and Challenges*

> Producing a fully functional app is the biggest win on this project. Being able to break down and handle the logic took some time for me but eventually I was able to focus on just one thing at a  time. My favorite part is the css as I'm happy to show off an interest of mine through a fun app and although tedious I do enjoy working with css. My biggest challenge was the logic behind checking and updating the wins of players. I did this a few different ways and didn't like how it was or wasn't in some cases working, so I took to the docs to see if there was anything that could aid me in solving this problem. In the end I solved it using a new method that I fully understand and plan to use again in future projects if given the chance. I had some difficulty being on the correct branches at times and not commiting as I should, but overall I feel I did much better with my commits and the messages attached to them. I know it's something I will continue to work on and master during my time at Turing.
